# 1_Special-functions-and-HHL-Algorithm-for-Solving-Generalized-MBVPs-with-Discontinuous-Coefficients
In this study we utilize special functions and Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm
for finding exact and approximate solutions of Generalized Heat Equation with known moving
boundaries and as an example we consider model problem in spherical coordinates used for modeling
electric contact erosion with Kohler's Effect. For approximate solutions of systems of MBVPs with
discontinuous coefficients the collocation method was used along with the Maximum Principle for
finding error estimates.
